 *	2010-08-21 rli: A handful of places that needed HILO to deal
 *	  with byte order of the combined record number/random record
 *	  position longword didn't get it:
 *
 *	  - setupsource when calculating the filesize.
 *	  - fillsource when clearing the record number if it's 128.
 *	  - setupdest when clearing the record number.
 *
 *	  It's not needed in checkrandom when copying the record number
 *	  from one FCB to another because treating the address of the
 *	  field as a byte pointer and picking off [0] will get the
 *	  record count field in either case.
 *
 *	2010-08-21 rli: setuser() was initializing its remembered
 *	  last user number to zero. This means that if you do
 *	  something like 2A> PIP A:=BOOGER.DAT[G0], it doesn't
 *	  realize that it needs to change the user number. Changed
 *	  initialization to 255.

/* 1  PIP'S FUNCTION							    */
/*									    */
/*	PIP, the Peripheral Interchange Program, copies data from one	    */
/*	or more peripheral or disk file to another peripheral or disk file. */
/*	It is also able to copy all files matching an ambiguous file name   */
/*	(one containing a wild card such as * or ?) from one disk to	    */
/*	another or from one user number to another.			    */
/*									    */
/*	Finally, PIP can concatenate data from more than one source file    */
/*	and/or device, sending the combined data to a single destination    */
/*	file or device.							    */
/*									    */
/*	While the copy is taking place, PIP can optionally perform checks   */
/*	- such as checking that an Intel Hex format file's checksums are    */
/*	correct, and translations - for example from upper to lower case.   */
/*	There are also facilites for adding line numbers to output and	    */
/*	formatting it into pages for printing.  It is also possible to	    */
/*	specify that only part of a file, delimited by start and end	    */
/*	strings, is copied.						    */
/*									    */
/*	When the destination is a disk file, PIP first copies all the	    */
/*	source data into a temporary file.  Only when the transfer has	    */
/*	completed without errors, and optional verification (if selected)   */
/*	has checked the data, does PIP delete any existing file with the    */
/*	destination file name and rename the temporary file to the	    */
/*	destination name.  This minimizes the possibility that a failing    */
/*	transfer will result in the loss of a backup or older version of    */
/*	the detination file.  In the event that a transfer does fail, PIP's */
/*	temporary file is not deleted in case it contains usable data.	    */
/*									    */
/* 2   PIP'S COMMAND MODES						    */
/*									    */
/*	PIP has two command modes: single and multiple.  In single command  */
/*	mode the user enters details of a single transfer on the command    */
/*	line following the name of the program, PIP.  For example,	    */
/*									    */
/*		A>PIP LST:=MYFILE.LST	(where A> is the CCP prompt)	    */
/*		A>			(prompt from CCP on completion)	    */
/*									    */
/*	copies A:MYFILE.LST to the LST: logical device (normally a printer) */
/*	and returns control to the CCP (Console Command Processor, CP/M's   */
/*	command interpreter) when the operation is complete.  See the next  */
/*	section for details of valid commands.				    */
/*									    */
/*	To enter multiple command mode, the user gives PIP no command line  */
/*	arguments.  In response, PIP prompts (with an asterisk) for	    */
/*	commands, and continues to do this until a blank line is entered,   */
/*	showing that the user has finished with PIP and wishes to return to */
/*	the CCP.  Suppose the user wants to make a backup copy of a file,   */
/*	then print it:							    */
/*									    */
/*		A>PIP			(Run PIP In multiple command mode)  */
/*		*MYFILE.BAK=MYFILE.C	(Make backup copy of a file)	    */
/*		*LST:=MYFILE.C		(Copy file to printer)		    */
/*		*			(User types return only)	    */
/*		A>			(Prompt from CCP)		    */
/*									    */
/*	This sequence of commands is a quicker alternative to running PIP   */
/*	twice in single command mode to achieve the same effect because PIP */
/*	is only loaded from disk once instead of twice.	It also reduces the */
/*	amount of typing required.					    */
/*									    */
/* 3   SOURCES AND DESTINATIONS						    */
/*									    */
/*	PIP knows about three classes of data source or destination:	    */
/*	logical devices, files and disks.				    */
/*									    */
/* 3.1 Logical Devices							    */
/*									    */
/*	The following table lists the logical devices known to the system.  */
/*	These devices are mapped to actual physical devices in CP/M's BIOS  */
/*	(Basic Input/Output System) software.  Many CP/M implementations    */
/*	allow the operator to change the mapping by manipulating a system   */
/*	variable, IOBYTE either with direct operating system calls or with  */
/*	the STAT utility.  MP/M does not have this facility.		    */
/*									    */
/*	Name	| Function		| Src?	| Dst?	| Comments	    */
/*	--------+-----------------------+-------+-------+---------------    */
/*	AXI:	| Auxilliary input	| Yes	| No	| Serial input,	    */
/*		|			|	|	|  tape reader etc. */
/*	AXO:	| Auxilliary output	| No	| Yes	| Serial ouput,     */
/*		|			|	|	|  tape punch etc.  */
/*	CON:	| Console		| Yes	| Yes	| Input is keyboard,*/
/*		|			|	|	|  output is screen */
/*	EOF:	| End of file character | Yes	| No	| Dummy device	    */
/*	INP:	| (User defined input)	| No	| No	| Obsolete: not	    */
/*		|			|	|	|  supported	    */
/*	LST:	| List device		| No	| Yes	| System printer    */
/*	NUL:	| Null trailer for paper| Yes	| No	| Dummy device	    */
/*		|  tape runout		|	|	|		    */
/*	PRN:	| Print on 66 line pages| No	| Yes	| Actually same	    */
/*		|  with line numbers	|	|	|  device as LST:   */
/*	OUT:	| (User defined output) | No	| No	| Obsolete: not	    */
/*		|			|	|	|  supported	    */
/*									    */
/* 3.2 Files								    */
/*									    */
/*	File names come in two forms: unambiguous and ambiguous.  Both have */
/*	the form							    */
/*									    */
/*		d:filename.typ;password					    */
/*									    */
/*		where d:	is an optional disk name.  If missing, the  */
/*				current disk is assumed			    */
/*		      filename  is a 1 to 8 character name consisting of    */
/*				alphabetic, numeric underscore or wildcard  */
/*				characters (* or ?)			    */
/*		      .ext	is an optional file type (1 to 3 of the     */
/*				characters which may appear in filename.)   */
/*				If missing, presumed blank		    */
/*		      password  is a 1 to 8 character password.  If not	    */
/*				given for a file which requires a password, */
/*				PIP prompts the user for one.  Passwords    */
/*				are implemented only in MP/M and CP/M	    */
/*				version 3.0 or later			    */
/*									    */
/*	The difference between unambiguous and ambiguous filenames is that  */
/*	the latter contain one or more wildcard while the former do not.    */
/*	An asterisk anywhere in a filename makes that name match all names. */
/*	A question mark specifies a single "don't care" character.  Similar */
/*	rules apply to file types.					    */
/*									    */
/*	Ambiguous filenames are not allowed as destinations, nor may they   */
/*	appear in or in place of lists of source files to be concatenated.  */
/*	They are used in copying groups of files from one disk or user to   */
/*	another.							    */
/*									    */
/*	Files are held on disk and come in two flavors: ASCII and binary.   */
/*	A control-Z in an ASCII file marks the logical end of the file.	    */
/*	Control-Z has no special significance in a binary file.  In most    */
/*	cases this distinction is unimportant to PIP.  The only time when   */
/*	it needs to know that it is not dealing with an ASCII file is when  */
/*	it is concatenating non-ASCII files (see 4.x below).  The O option  */
/*	(section 5) should be used in this case.			    */
/*									    */
/*	Files may be dense or sparse.  Suppose the last record in a file    */
/*	has logical record number 7.  If 8 physical records (sectors)	    */
/*	(zero through seven) on the disk have been allocated to that file,  */
/*	then the file is dense: there is a physical sector allocated for    */
/*	each logical sector, and the physical size of the file is the same  */
/*	as the logical size.  This is the normal case: files created by the */
/*	editor, object files, command files, and most files created by	    */
/*	programs have this structure.  A sparse file, on the other hand,    */
/*	has fewer physical records than logical records.  Thus a file with  */
/*	8 logical sectors might have as few as one physical sector.  Such   */
/*	files can only be created with the CP/M random write system call,   */
/*	and are typically used by specialized programs such as database	    */
/*	managers and indexed access file handlers.			    */
/*									    */
/*	PIP automatically accomodates both dense and sparse files and	    */
/*	copies only those sectors which are actually allocated in the	    */
/*	source when copying a sparse file.  The resulting destination file  */
/*	is also sparse.  PIP does not allow sparse files to be concatenated.*/
/*									    */
/* 3.3 Disks								    */
/*									    */
/*	A disk name has the form d: where d is a letter from A through P.   */
/*	Disk names are used by PIP as a form of shorthand to cut down on    */
/*	the number of keystrokes needed to achieve a given effect.  In	    */
/*	effect, the disk name stands in for a filename or list of filenames */
/*	which the user has specified elsewhere on the same command line.    */
/*	4.4 and 4.6 below show the two cases where as disk name may be used.*/
/*									    */
/* 4   PIP COMMANDS							    */
/*									    */
/*	The general format of PIP commands is				    */
/*									    */
/*		dest[options]=source1[options],source2[options]...	    */
/*									    */
/*		where dest	is a disk, a logical device or an unambig-  */
/*				uous filename (no wildcards)		    */
/*		      source1	is a disk, a logical device, or an	    */
/*				ambiguous or unambiguous file name	    */
/*		      source2   is a logical device or unabiguous file name */
/*				(there may be more than one, separated by   */
/*				commas)					    */
/*		      options	enclosed in square brackets may appear	    */
/*				after any destination or source		    */
/*									    */
/*	Not all possible combinations are valid.  The remainder of this     */
/*	section details those which are.  For details of valid options, see */
/*	the next section.						    */
/*									    */
/* 4.1 Device to device copy						    */
/*									    */
/*	dst:=src:							    */
/*									    */
/*	copies data from the logical device src: to the logical device	    */
/*	dst:.  Both src: and dst: are three-character logical device names  */
/*	followed by a colon.  Note that a single letter followed by a colon */
/*	is NOT a logical device name, but a disk name (see below.)  For	    */
/*	example,							    */
/*									    */
/*		LST:=AXI:						    */
/*									    */
/*	copies data from the auxiliary input (typically a serial line or    */ 
/*	tape reader) to the list device, typically a printer.		    */
/*									    */
/* 4.2 File to device copy						    */
/*									    */
/*	src:=ufn	(ufn is an unambiguous file name)		    */
/*									    */
/*	copies a single file with an unambiguous name to a destination	    */
/*	device.  For example to print the file PROGRAM.LST,		    */
/*									    */
/*		PRT:=PROGRAM.LST					    */
/*									    */
/* 4.3 Device to file copy						    */
/*									    */
/*	ufn=dst:							    */
/*									    */
/*	copies data from a logical device to a file.  This function is	    */
/*	useful for reading disk files from paper tape and for creating	    */
/*	short text files from the keyboard.  These two functions would be   */
/*	performed by							    */
/*									    */
/*		B:PROGRAM.ASM=AXI:					    */
/*		COMMAND.SUB=CON:					    */
/*									    */
/* 4.4 File to file copy						    */
/*									    */
/*	ufn=ufn	   ufn=d:    d:=ufn					    */
/*									    */
/*	copies one unambiguously named file to another.  For example, to    */
/*	make a backup copy of a file VALUABLE.DAT in VALUABLE.BAK, use	    */
/*									    */
/*		VALUABLE.BAK=VALUABLE.DAT				    */
/*									    */
/*	File attributes and, in the case of CP/M 3.0 and MP/M, extended file*/
/*	information are copied along with the file.  Thus a copy of a read- */
/*	only file is automatically made read only, and a copy of an MP/M    */
/*	file with password protection on write has similar protection.	    */
/*									    */
/*	Special cases of this command can be used to copy an unambiguously  */
/*	named file from one disk to a file of the same name on another	    */
/*	disk.  To copy VALUABLE.DAT on drive A to VALUABLE.DAT on drive B,  */
/*	either								    */
/*									    */
/*		B:VALUABLE.DAT=A:  or  B:=A:VALUABLE.DAT		    */
/*									    */
/*	does the job.  Both are shorter than the long form		    */
/*									    */
/*		B:VALUABLE.DAT=A:VALUABLE.DAT				    */
/*									    */
/* 4.5 Concatenation							    */
/*									    */
/*	dst=src1,src2,...srcn						    */
/*									    */
/*	The commands of 4.1 to 4.4 (except the special cases of 4.4) can    */
/*	be generalized to concatenate data from a variety of sources into a */
/*	single destination file or device.  Each argument is a device	    */
/*	name or unambiguous file name.  PIP reads each source in turn,	    */
/*	copying it to the destination.  For example, to append data from    */
/*	paper tape to an existing file:					    */
/*									    */
/*		BIGGER.SRC=SMALLER.SRC,AXI:				    */
/*									    */
/* 4.6 Multiple file copy						    */
/*									    */
/*	d:=afn    d:[Gn]=afn	(afn is an ambiguous file name)		    */
/*									    */
/*	When an ambiguous filename is used as a source, PIP recognizes that */
/*	it must copy each file matched by the source name to a destination  */
/*	file of the same name, but on a different disk or belonging to a    */
/*	different user (the Gn option specifies user n.)  It is an error to */
/*	try copying files belonging to one user on one disk to the same     */
/*	user on the same disk!  As an example, to copy all .TXT files from  */
/*	the current drive to drive B (which must not be the current drive): */
/*									    */
/*		B:=*.TXT						    */
/*									    */
/*	To copy all files belonging to the current user on drive B to user  */
/*	7 (who must not be the current user) on drive B:		    */
/*									    */
/*		B:[G7]=B:*.*						    */
/*									    */
/* 5   OPTIONS								    */
/*									    */
/*	A list of options enclosed in square brackets may follow any file   */
/*	or device name.  Each option consists of a letter, possibly followed*/
/*	by a decimal number n or a control-Z terminated string s.  Where an */
/*	option requires neither string nor number, any following number or  */
/*	string is misinterpreted as more options.  An error always results. */
/*	A missing number is taken to be 1.  There need be no separators	    */
/*	between options, though spaces are allowed.  Most combinations of   */
/*	options are accepted without objection, although some make little   */
/*	sense and may produce unexpected results.			    */
/*									    */
/*	Any letter is accepted as an option, although some (for example B)  */
/*	have no effect.  The following table lists implemented options	    */
/*	and the context (following source or destination in which they make */
/*	sense:								    */
/*									    */
/*	Opt  | Src | Dst | Description					    */
/*	-----+-----+-----+----------------------------------------------    */
/*	A    | Yes | No  | Copy only those disk files which DO NOT have the */
/*	     |     |	 |  archive bit set in at least one extent	    */
/*	     |	   |	 |  (selective back-up of modified files)	    */
/*	Dn   | Yes | No  | Delete characters after column n (truncate for   */
/*	     |	   |	 |  narrow paper or screen)			    */
/*	E    | Yes | No  | Echo data to console as it is transfered	    */
/*	F    | Yes | No	 | Remove form feeds from data as it is copied	    */
/*	Gn   | Yes | Yes | Specify (Get) user number for source or	    */
/*	     |	   |	 |  destination disk file			    */
/*	H    | Yes | No  | Check that the data is a valid Intel Hex file    */
/*	I    | Yes | No  | Ignore (do not transfer) final :00 record in	    */
/*	     |	   |	 |  Intel Hex file (used for concatenating files)   */
/*	L    | Yes | No  | Translate lower case alphabetic to upper	    */
/*	Nn   | Yes | No  | Prepend line numbers to output data.  Leading 0's*/
/*	     |	   |	 |  not supressed if n=2			    */
/*	O    | Yes | No  | Object file.  Ignore end-of-file marks	    */
/*	Pn   | Yes | No  | Output page eject (form feed) every n lines	    */
/*	     |	   |	 |  (default 60)				    */
/*	Qs   | Yes | No  | Quit (stop) transfering data after the string s  */
/*	     |     |     |  has been copied				    */
/*	R    | Yes | No  | Read system files (system attribute set).  By    */
/*	     |	   |	 |  default such files are not read		    */
/*	S    | Yes | No  | Start transfering data when the string s is	    */
/*	     |	   |	 |  found in input data.  s is first data copied    */
/*	Tn   | Yes | No  | Expand tabs at every n columns (default 8)	    */
/*	U    | Yes | No  | Translate lower case alphabetic to upper	    */
/*	V    | Yes | No  | Check destination disk file for readability (not */
/*	     |	   |	 |  correctness) after transfer complete	    */
/*	W    | Yes | No  | Overwrite read-only destination file (supress    */
/*	     |     |     |  PIP's normal query to user before overwriting)  */
/*	Z    | Yes | No  | Zero parity bit.  Normally parity bit is copied  */
/*									    */
/* 6   HOW IT WORKS							    */
/*									    */
/*	The best way to understand this somewhat knotty program is to start */
/*	at the _main function which is to be found at the end of this	    */
/*	listing and work backwards to progressively lower level functions   */
/*	as and when it becomes necessary to know what they do and how they  */
/*	do it.								    */
/*									    */
/*	For historical reasons, much of the communication between functions */
/*	is accomplished with global variables rather than parameters,	    */
/*	resulting in long-range interdependencies which may be hard to	    */
/*	follow.  A cross-reference listing is useful in tracking these	    */
/*	down.  All the global variables are global because they have to be  */
/*	that way: if you see one, at least two functions use it.	    */
